      <h3>How I Became Interested:</h3>
        <p>While I was attending the High School of Computers and Technology from 2016 to 2020 I had a teacher who was heavily into the stock market and philosophy. I picked up skills in investing and also an interest in philosophy, specifically Stoicism. 
         In Stoicism there are the <em>Big Three</em> Stoics which are Seneca, Epictetus, and Marus Aurelius. In particular, I am most fascinated in the teachings of Marcus Aurelius's <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
      
      <h3>Stoicism Defined:</h3>
        <pre>“Stoicism is focusing on things that are in your control, overcoming negative emotions, living in the present moment, 
helping others for the common good, and finding opportunity in every obstacle.” <em>Phil Van Treuren.</em></pre>

      <h3>Here Are Some of My Favorite Quotes</h3>    
      <ul> 
        
        <li>    
            <pre>“If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. 
Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, 
by treating it as in your interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.” <em>- Marcus Aurelius</em>
            </pre>  
        </li>

        <li>  <pre>"In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control
