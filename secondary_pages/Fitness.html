      <h3>How I Became Interested</h3>
      <p>Like Philosophy, my interest in Fitness started when I went to The High School of Computers and Technology 2016-2020. I enjoy working out as it's something that I can see physical results when progressing and because it's a great stress relief tool. I also work out to keep my body in good physical shape. I've personally noticed that I feel worse after a long break from exercise.</p>
